            <h2>Understanding Energy, Work, and Power</h2>
            <p>Energy, work, and power are fundamental concepts in physics that help us understand how and why things move and change. They are closely related but distinct ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="energy">
            <h2>Energy</h2>
            <p>Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms, such as kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy). Energy is a scalar quantity and is measured in Joules (J).</p>
            
            <h3>Kinetic Energy (KE)</h3>
            <p>Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> KE = (1/2)mv² (where m is mass and v is velocity)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A moving car has kinetic energy. The faster it moves or the heavier it is, the more kinetic energy it has.</p>

            <h3>Potential Energy (PE)</h3>
            <p>Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or condition. A common type is gravitational potential energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy Formula:</strong> PE = mgh (where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approx. 9.8 m/s² on Earth), and h is the height)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A book held above the ground has gravitational potential energy. If you lift it higher, its potential energy increases.</p>
            
            <h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>
            <p>The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.</p>

        <section id="work">
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>In physics, work is done when a force applied to an object causes a displacement of that object. For work to be done, the force must have a component in the direction of the displacement.</p>
            <p>Work is a scalar quantity and is also measured in Joules (J).</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> W = Fd cos(θ) (where F is the magnitude of the force, d is the magnitude of the displacement, and θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors). If the force is in the same direction as the displacement, W = Fd.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Lifting a box from the floor to a shelf is work. Pushing a wall that doesn't move results in no work done on the wall, even if you get tired!</p>
        </section>

        <section id="power">
            <h2>Power</h2>
            <p>Power is the rate at which work is done, or the rate at which energy is transferred or transformed.</p>
            <p>Power is a scalar quantity and is measured in Watts (W), where 1 Watt = 1 Joule/second.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> P = W / Δt (where W is work done, and Δt is the time taken) or P = ΔE / Δt (where ΔE is the change in energy, and Δt is the time taken)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If two people lift identical boxes to the same height, the person who does it faster is more powerful, even though they both do the same amount of work.</p>
