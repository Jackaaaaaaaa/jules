            <h2>What is Kinematics?</h2>
            <p>Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. It's all about describing motion - how things move, not why they move.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>Displacement</h3>
            <p>Displacement is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (how far) and direction. It's different from distance, which only has magnitude.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Δx = x_f - x_i (where Δx is displacement, x_f is the final position, and x_i is the initial position)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a car moves 500 meters east from a starting point, its displacement is 500 meters east.</p>

            <h3>Velocity</h3>
            <p>Velocity is the rate at which an object changes its position. It is also a vector quantity (speed with a direction).</p>
            <p><strong>Average Velocity Formula:</strong> v_avg = Δx / Δt (where Δx is displacement, and Δt is the change in time)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the car that moved 500 meters east took 50 seconds, its average velocity is 10 meters per second east.</p>

            <h3>Speed</h3>
            <p>Speed is the rate at which an object covers distance. It is a scalar quantity (it only has magnitude).</p>
            <p><strong>Average Speed Formula:</strong> s = total distance / total time</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a person runs 100 meters in 10 seconds, their average speed is 10 m/s.</p>

            <h3>Acceleration</h3>
            <p>Acceleration is the rate at which an object changes its velocity. It is a vector quantity.</p>
            <p>An object is accelerating if its speed is changing, its direction is changing, or both are changing.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> a = Δv / Δt (where Δv is the change in velocity, and Δt is the change in time)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A car speeding up from 0 m/s to 20 m/s in 10 seconds has an acceleration of 2 m/s².</p>

            <h2>Equations of Motion (for constant acceleration)</h2>
            <p>For objects moving with constant acceleration, we can use a set of equations known as the kinematic equations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>v_f = v_i + at</li>
                <li>Δx = v_i*t + (1/2)at²</li>
                <li>v_f² = v_i² + 2aΔx</li>
                <li>Δx = (v_i + v_f)/2 * t</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>v_f = final velocity</li>
                <li>v_i = initial velocity</li>
                <li>a = acceleration</li>
                <li>t = time</li>
                <li>Δx = displacement</li>
            </ul>
