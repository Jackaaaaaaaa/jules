            <h2>What is Dynamics?</h2>
            <p>Dynamics is a branch of physics (specifically classical mechanics) concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion. While kinematics describes motion, dynamics explains *why* objects move the way they do. The foundation of dynamics was laid by Sir Isaac Newton with his three laws of motion.</p>

            <h2>Newton's Laws of Motion</h2>
            
            <h3>Newton's First Law: The Law of Inertia</h3>
            <p>Newton's First Law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>
            <p>In simpler terms, objects tend to keep doing what they're already doing. This tendency to resist changes in their state of motion is called inertia.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you roll a ball on a smooth, level surface, it will continue to roll until friction (an unbalanced force) or another object stops it. A book resting on a table stays at rest unless you push it.</p>

            <h3>Newton's Second Law: Force and Acceleration</h3>
            <p>Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of the net force.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> F_net = ma (where F_net is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is its acceleration)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> It takes more force to accelerate a heavy truck than a small car at the same rate because the truck has more mass. If you push a shopping cart with more force, it accelerates more quickly.</p>

            <h3>Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction</h3>
            <p>Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
            <p>This means that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. These two forces are often called an "action-reaction pair."</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you jump, your legs apply a force to the ground (action), and the ground applies an equal and opposite force (reaction) that propels you into the air. When a rocket expels gas downwards (action), the expanding gas pushes the rocket upwards (reaction).</p>

            <h2>Related Concepts</h2>
            <p><strong>Force:</strong> A push or a pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object. Forces can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (to accelerate).</p>
            <p><strong>Mass:</strong> A measure of the amount of matter in an object and also a measure of its inertia (resistance to acceleration).</p>
            <p><strong>Net Force:</strong> The vector sum of all forces acting on an object. If the net force is zero, the object's velocity is constant (it's either at rest or moving at a constant velocity).</p>
